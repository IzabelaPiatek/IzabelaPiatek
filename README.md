## 💬 About me
Hi, my name is Iza and I have been working as a **software tester** since October 2023. At work, I am involved in bug reporting, ticket analysis, creating scenarios, test cases and working with the development team. In my free time, I develop my passion for web development. Currently, I have started learning **automated testing**. 
- I'm crazy about photography  📷 
- I love to travel and explore new places with my husband and our son  👪
- I'm keen on reading romance and fantasy books 📖
- I like footbal and support Borussia Dortmund 💛

## ⚡ Fun fact
During my studies I wanted to become a front-end developer, but at the end of my studies I decided that IT was not for me.
Fortunately, I defended myself from IT for only two years and decided to become a software tester. Best of all, the work **gives me great pleasure** and I **enjoy** doing it.
